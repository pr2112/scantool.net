# scantool.net

This git repository is being used to capture my enhancements to the open source OBD2
scan tool developed by Scantool.net.

The initial version of the source was cloned from [here](https://github.com/milaq/scantool.net).
That source was derived from the final v1.21 source released by Scantool.net.  They no
longer support the tool.
